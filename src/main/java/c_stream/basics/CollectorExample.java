        /**
         * The final parameter is the combiner, which is another BiConsumer. It is responsible for
         * taking two data collections and merging them. This is useful when we are processing in
         * parallel. Two smaller collections are formed and then merged into one. This would work
         * with StringBuilder only if we didnâ€™t care about the order of the letters. In this case, the accumulator
         * and combiner have similar logic.
         * The collector has three parts as before. The supplier creates an empty TreeSet. The accumulator
         * adds a single String from the Stream to the TreeSet. The combiner adds all of
         * the elements of one TreeSet to another in case the operations were done in parallel and
         * need to be merged.
